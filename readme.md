# Project: Build a Task Management API (with Authentication)

This project is a full-fledged RESTful API that allows users to manage their tasks, create, read, update, and delete tasks. Include user authentication, ensuring that each user has their own set of tasks. Below is the breakdown of the key features.

## 1. Basic Setup & API Design

- **Express.js** for routing and middleware.
- Set up basic routes for task management (CRUD operations) for tasks like:
  - `GET /tasks`
  - `POST /tasks`
  - `PUT /task/:id`
  - `DELETE /task/:id`
- Implement a task model using a **MongoDB** database (using **Mongoose**), where tasks have properties like:
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `completed` (boolean)
  - `dueDate`
- Use **Postman** or **Insomnia** to test your API endpoints.

## 2. User Authentication & Authorization

- Implement **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication to secure the API, requiring users to sign up and log in.
- Use **bcrypt.js** to hash passwords before storing them.
- Protect certain routes (like updating or deleting tasks) so that users can only interact with their own tasks.

## 3. Task Filtering & Sorting

- Allow users to filter tasks by:
  - `completed`
  - `dueDate`
  - `priority`
- Implement pagination for task lists if a user has many tasks.
- Add sorting options to allow users to sort tasks by various fields (e.g., `dueDate` or `priority`).

## 4. Email Notifications

- Use **Nodemailer** to send email notifications when a task is due or when a user completes a task.
- Set up a **cron job** to check for due tasks and send notifications.

## 5. Testing & Error Handling

- Write unit tests for your API using **Mocha** and **Chai** to ensure everything works as expected.
- Add proper error handling for edge cases like missing fields, invalid input, or authentication failures.

## 6. Deployment

- Deploy the app to **Heroku**, **Vercel**, or another cloud service to make it accessible from anywhere.
- Use **MongoDB Atlas** for hosting the database in the cloud.

## 7. Bonus Features

- Implement a **web socket** for real-time updates, such as notifying users when tasks are updated by others (for collaborative task management).
- Use **Swagger** to document your API endpoints and make them easily discoverable by other developers.
